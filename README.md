# **Personal Portfolio**
Welcome to my photography portfolio! My name is Maimuna Omar and I'm a passionate photographer with a love for capturing the beauty of nature. As a landscape and cloudscape photographer, I strive to capture stunning images that showcase the grandeur and majesty of the natural world.

# About Me
I'm always on the lookout for unique perspectives and interesting compositions that tell a story through my photographs. Whether I'm exploring new locations or revisiting old favorites, I aim to create images that inspire others to appreciate the beauty of the world around us and to see it through a new lens.

**Portfolio**
On my portfolio page, you'll find a collection of my favorite photographs. Each image includes a brief description that provides context and highlights what inspired me to take the shot.
